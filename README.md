### Introduction
This project addresses the challenge of uncertain seat availability in public transport. It provides real-time updates on seat occupancy and tracks the bus's location. By using a Raspberry Pi to control a camera module, the system monitors the available seats and sends updates to a web-based frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features
- Real-time Seat Tracking: Displays the number of available seats on the bus.
- Location Tracking: Tracks and displays the current bus location.
- Camera Monitoring: Uses a camera attached to Raspberry Pi to monitor seat occupancy.
- User Interface: A web-based interface that shows seat availability and bus location.
- Backend: Python-based server for processing seat data and tracking.

### Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python
- Raspberry Pi OS: Controls the camera for seat monitoring
- Camera Module: Detects seat occupancy
- GPS Module: For bus location tracking

### Hardware Requirements
